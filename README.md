# Challenge #9 - Puppet v2

The developers of the last lending pool are saying that they've learned the lesson. And just released a new version!

Now they're using a Uniswap v2 exchange as a price oracle, along with the recommended utility libraries. That should be enough.

You start with 20 ETH and 10000 DVT tokens in balance. The new lending pool has a million DVT tokens in balance. You know what to do ;)
